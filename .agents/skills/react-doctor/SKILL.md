description: Run React Doctor only when the user explicitly types `/doctor`, explicitly says "run React Doctor," or explicitly asks to use React Doctor. Do not trigger for ordinary feature work, bug fixes, React edits, cleanup, reviews, commits, scans, triage, linting, accessibility work, bundle analysis, or architecture work unless React Doctor is explicitly requested.

# React Doctor

Scans React codebases for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0–100 health score.

React Doctor is opt-in. Do not run it as a routine regression check after changes, during cleanup, or before commits. Invoke it only after an explicit user request matching the frontmatter description.

## /doctor — full local triage workflow

When the user types `/doctor`, says "run react doctor", or asks for a full triage / cleanup pass (not just a regression check), fetch the canonical local-triage playbook and follow every step in it:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  https://www.react.doctor/prompts/react-doctor-agent.md
```

The playbook is the single source of truth — a scan → filter → triage → fix → validate loop that edits the working tree directly (never commits, never opens PRs). Updating the prompt at its source updates every agent on its next fetch — no skill reinstall needed.

Pair it with the matching per-rule prompts at `https://www.react.doctor/prompts/rules/<plugin>/<rule>.md` (fetched on demand inside the playbook) so each fix uses the canonical, reviewer-tested recipe.

## Configuring or explaining rules

When the user wants to understand a rule, disagrees with one, or wants to disable / tune which rules run (not fix code), read [references/explain.md](references/explain.md) and follow it. Start with `npx react-doctor@latest rules explain <rule>`, then apply the narrowest control via `npx react-doctor@latest rules disable|set|category|ignore-tag …`, which edits your `doctor.config.*` (or `package.json#reactDoctor`).

## Command

```bash
npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --scope changed
```
